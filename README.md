# Flappy-Bird-Long-Lost-Cousin

This code is a Flappy Bird game implementation in C++ using the graphics.h library. 

The code has a Ball, Pole, and Player class. The Ball class handles the movement of the bird, the Pole class handles the generation and movement of the pipes, and the Player class handles the scoring system. The game ends when the bird collides with the pipe. 

The menu function displays a menu where the user can start the game, view the previous score, or exit the game.

Note: The graphics.h library is required to run this program and may not run on your systems.
